Manual software installations
==============================

The following manual software installations may or may not be required as prerequisites, depending on the specific platform. For configurable/user systems, please consult Sect ...., for preconfigured systems please consult Section ... . Note that for the latter, this is only necessary for the maintainers of the preconfigured installations, users **do not** have to repeat any of these steps.

------------------------------
Miniconda
------------------------------

If required, miniconda can be used to provide a basic version of Python that spack-stack uses to support its Python packages.

In the following instructions, replace ``/work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda`` with the directory where your ``miniconda-3.9.7`` directory will be installed.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda
   mkdir -p miniconda-3.9.7/src
   cd miniconda-3.9.7/src
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -u
   # Accept license agreement
   # Install in /work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda/miniconda-3.9.7
   # Do not have the installer initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init

Create modulefile ``/work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda/modulefiles/miniconda/3.9.7`` from template ``doc/modulefile_templates/miniconda`` and update ``MINICONDA_PATH`` in this file. Then:

.. code-block:: console

   module use /work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda/modulefiles
   module load miniconda/3.9.7
   which python3
   # make sure this points to the new miniconda install

Install two packages required for building Python modules with spack using ``conda``

.. code-block:: console

   eval "$(/work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda/miniconda-3.9.7/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
   conda install -c conda-forge libpython-static
   conda install poetry
   # Test, successful if silent
   python3 -c "import poetry"
   # log out to forget about the conda environment

To use this installation of miniconda, the following needs to be done every time before installing packages with spack or before using the modules created by spack.

.. code-block:: console

   module use /work/noaa/gsd-hpcs/dheinzel/jcsda/modulefiles
   module load miniconda/3.9.7

------------------------------
git-lfs
------------------------------

Building ``git-lfs`` with spack isn't straightforward as it requires ``go-bootstrap`` and ``go`` language support, which many compilers don't build correctly. We therefore require ``git-lfs`` as an external package. On many of the HPC systems, it is already available as a separate module or as part of a ``git`` module. On macOS and Linux, it can be installed using ``brew`` or other package managers (see Section **MISSING** for examples). Section **MISSING** describes a manual installation of ``git-lfs`` on TACC Stampede, a Centos7 system.
